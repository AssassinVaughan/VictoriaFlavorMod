  journal_flavor_central_america.1.t: "The Livingston Penal Code"
  journal_flavor_central_america.1.d: "As the sweeping liberal reforms continue across the country, Guatemala is planning to adopt the Livingston Penal Code."
  journal_flavor_central_america.1.f: "Guatemala is the largest state of the FRCA and covers vast jungles, mountains and hills inhabited by primarily native and mixed people, many of whom were vivid supporters of the Conservative Regime that was toppled by Morazán in 1829.\n\nAs part of the sweeping liberal reforms, Guatemala began to implement trial by jury since 1835, causing widespread unrest among the Guatemalan population who still cling onto the Spanish colonial system of the fueros. However, the adoption of the Livingston Penal Code is an important step towards the modernization of the judicial system across the country at large and the liberal governments in San Salvador and Guatemala City insist upon its adoption."
  journal_flavor_central_america.1.a: "Towards a brighter future!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.1.b: "Trial by Jury will suffice for now."

  journal_flavor_central_america.2.f: "A troubling development in [SCOPE.sState('cholera_affect_state').GetName] as cholera hits the province. Having possibly spread across state borders or via the coastal ports, the disease has become a widespread phenomenon in the region. If not checked, it is likely that the disease will spread further throughout the country."
  journal_flavor_central_america.2.a: "Quarantine the Province!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.2.b: "We cannot afford it right now."

  journal_flavor_central_america.3.b: "Quarantine every Province!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.4.t: "Nicaragua Secedes!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.4.d: "Following recent events, a new assembly in Nicaragua has met to draft a new constitution."
  journal_flavor_central_america.4.f: "With the overthrow of the liberal assembly in Nicaragua, the new conservative government has declared its secession from the union by illegaly adopting a new constitution in which they proclaim Nicaragua to be a free and independent nation. They cite the inability of the federal government to keep order in the province, as well as the misery brought about in the isthmus, as the reason for their outrageous move. They dedicate themselves towards reforming the region into a mere confederation of independent states."
  journal_flavor_central_america.4.a: "They will regret this soon enough!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.4.b: "Nicaragua will prevail! Long live the conservative revolution!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.5.t: "Military Coup in Costa Rica!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.5.d: "Braulio Carrillo Colina has overthrown the government of Costa Rica as tensions continue to escalate"
  journal_flavor_central_america.5.f: "#bold Braulio Carrillo Colina#!, former head of state of Costa Rica, has usurped the provincial government in an attempt to secede from the Federal Pact.\n\nWe must intervene immediately or risk the continued disintegration of the union."
  journal_flavor_central_america.5.a: "This is still salvageable!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.5.b: "Costa Rica will prevail! Towards a free Costa Rica!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.6.t: "A New Guatemalan Assembly!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.6.d: "Long dissatisfied with its loss of pre-eminence within the union, a new conservative regional assembly has declared the formation of a new and independent Guatemala!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.6.f: "As the isthmus continues to descend into turmoil, the Liberal assembly in Guatemala has finally conceded and allowed the conservative opposition to partake in the provincial government. Under new leadership, Guatemala has begun drafting a new constitution which declares the province to be an independent nation.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the Liberal faction will allow for a complete secession, they are rapidly losing ground to the conservatives who have gone as far as to appoint the reactionary partisan Rafael Carrera to become the first president of the new republic."
  journal_flavor_central_america.6.a: "How could they..."
  journal_flavor_central_america.6.b: "Guatemala will prevail!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.7.t: "Honduras Declares Independence!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.7.d: "Long seen as the most loyal of the provinces and as the birthplace of Morazán himself, the union is shaken to its core as the regional assembly under Francisco Ferrera declares its independence."
  journal_flavor_central_america.7.f: "The union continues to rapidly lose cohesion as in latest events, Honduras has declares its independence. Once the most loyal of the provinces, the complete collapse of federal authority throughout the rest of the country has prompted the regional assembly to adopt a new constitution which declares Honduras to be a free and sovereign country.\n\nThe loss of Honduras is a major setback to the Central American project and the dissolution seems to be all but certain now."
  journal_flavor_central_america.7.a: "The union is not yet lost!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.7.b: "Honduras will prevail!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.8.t: "The End of the Union?"
  journal_flavor_central_america.8.d: "The regional assembly in San Salvador has proposed to adopt a new constitution as the republic has effectively disintegrated."
  journal_flavor_central_america.8.f: "What started with minor turmoil in the provinces has quickly spiraled into a nation-wide collapse as each region has declared its independence from the central government.\n\nWhile these declarations don’t mean much on their own, the lack of federal authority means that beyond El Salvador, the federation has ceased to exist. The regional assembly has thus proposed to adopt a new constitution to dissolve what is left of the federation so that we may dedicate our limited resources towards the future of El Salvador alone.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to scramble whatever we have left and try to preserve the union by force, though this will put us in a state of war with every single province in the isthmus and will likely only delay the inevitable. "
  journal_flavor_central_america.8.a: "We will not give up without a fight!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.8.b: "El Salvador will prevail at last."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.9.t: "The End of the Federal Pact"
  journal_flavor_central_america.9.d: "Despite our best efforts, the Central American Union is no more."
  journal_flavor_central_america.9.f: "With our defeat against the provincial governments, the union has now officially been dissolved. In its place rise free and sovereign republics who can hopefully prevail in the face of stronger neighbors and imperialist powers."
  journal_flavor_central_america.9.a: "Let us hope this was worth it."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.10.t: "The Union Prevails!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.10.d: "Despite the seemingly hopeless situation, we have managed to forcefully bring the provinces back into the fold!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.10.f: "Many doubted the ability of the federal government to restore order across the nation, but what seemed so far-fetched has become a reality as federal troops victoriously march through the provincial capitals. From Guatemala to Costa Rica, Central America stands united once more and while this second war will undoubtedly cast a shadow for many generations to come, the union has at least prevailed. "
  journal_flavor_central_america.10.a: "For now, we shall rebuild."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.11.t: "Civil War in Guatemala!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.11.d: "Gálvez’s liberal government in Guatemala has lost control over the rural hinterlands of the province. Instead, a conservative insurgent by the name of #bold Rafael Carrera#! has taken over with the intend of bringing the conservative revolution to Central America!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.11.f: "Guatemala, the former capital of Central America, is dominated by a conservative landowning elite and illiterate peasant population that do not support the liberal government in San Salvador. While many reforms of our government were aimed at aiding the poor and integrating the rural province into the rest of the country, they have instead caused grievances and distrust among the locals.\n\nCapitalizing on this, #bold José Rafael Carrera#!, a peasant and puppet of the clergy and landowning elite, has now begun an armed uprising, bringing much of Guetamala under his control.\n\nGálvez, who was previously put in charge by Morazán to oversee the implementation of liberal reforms, has now requested for federal aid to put down the uprising."
  journal_flavor_central_america.11.a: "Morazán will restore order to Guatemala!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.11.b: "We cannot afford an intervention."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.12.t: "Secessionists in Nicaragua!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.12.d: "Renewed threats of secession have arisen in Nicaragua"
  journal_flavor_central_america.12.f: "The government of Nicaragua has voiced its concerns over the rising grip of the federal government over the provinces.\n\nMorazan’s inclination to use military might to topple provincial opposition governments has led to many in Nicaragua proposing to declare renewed secession of the province similar to 1832. While for now these are mere empty threats, letting the provincial government propose and foster such treasonous ideas will surely contribute to the further disintegration of the union and must thus be squashed before it can grow into an uncontrollable movement."
  journal_flavor_central_america.12.a: "Organize a Federal Response!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.12.b: "Intervention will only escalate the conflict."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.13.t: "Rising Tensions in Honduras"
  journal_flavor_central_america.13.d: "General Francisco Ferrera, has revolted against the Federal Government!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.13.f: "As tensions continue to boil across the region, Francisco Ferrera, former Chief of State of Honduras and former ally of Morazan, has declared the independence of Honduras and is preparing for a prolonged war to achieve the independence of his state from the FRCA."
  journal_flavor_central_america.13.a: "He will pay for this!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.14.t: "The Central American Confederation"
  journal_flavor_central_america.14.d: "With the Conservative Party in charge of the country, the once federal union is now being transformed into a mere confederation of independent states."
  journal_flavor_central_america.14.f: "Plagued by unrest and instability from the day of its inception, the Federal Republic of Central America has at last been dissolved under the new conservative government. Citing the inherent danger of having a federal government, and fearing another liberal regime coming to power, the individual provinces have decided to peacefully part ways."
  journal_flavor_central_america.14.a: "At least bloodshed has been avoided."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.15.t: "Order Restored in Nicaragua"
  journal_flavor_central_america.15.d: "Officials in Nicaragua have reoriented themselves towards the future of the union following a federal intervention!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.15.f: "While the Intervention in Nicaragua was seen as controversial by many, it has proven to be a necessity as the show of force by the Federal Government has "reassured" the local conservatives that there may yet be hope in the union."
  journal_flavor_central_america.15.a: "The Federal Republic is not yet lost!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.16.t: "Conservative Coup in Nicaragua"
  journal_flavor_central_america.16.d: "Following the escalation of tensions in Nicaragua, the conservatives have managed to overthrow the provincial government!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.16.f: "Our inability to stop the conflict in Nicaragua has led to the downfall of the liberal government following a conservative coup. The province is quickly turning into a center of separatist and reformist sentiment."
  journal_flavor_central_america.16.a: "Worrisome..."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.18.t: "The Father of the Nation"
  journal_flavor_central_america.18.d: "Former President Francisco Morazán has passed recently. A great visionary thinker and seen by many as the true founder of our nation, a proposal has been put forth to erect a monument in his honor."
  journal_flavor_central_america.18.f: "Francisco Morazán, former president of the Federal Republic from 1830 until 1839, has sadly passed away last night in his sleep.\n\nA great revolutionary thinker and staunch liberal reformer, Morazán has laid the foundation for our reformed republic and saved it from certain collapse through his meticulous diplomatic and military skills. Hadn’t it been for him, the Federation as we know it may no longer exist today.\n\nAlready during his lifetime, Morazán was drawing in a large crowd of vivid supporters and with his death, his cult of personality will only continue to grow in size. A proposal has been put forth in the assembly to erect a monument in his honor and to rename the department of his birth to his name to pay homage to his great deeds."
  journal_flavor_central_america.18.a: "He will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders of the 19th century!"
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.19.t: "The Republic of Los Altos"
  journal_flavor_central_america.19.d: "As the war in Guatemala drags on, the liberals in eastern Chiapas have put forth a proposal to establish a new Republic of the Highlands to weaken the Guatemalan position within the union."
  journal_flavor_central_america.19.f: "Liberals in Guatemala, long dissatisfied with the dominant position of Guatemala within the Federal Republic, have put forth a proposal to the military expedition under Morazán to establish a new Federal Subject in the Guatemalan Highlands.\n\nThis proposed Republic of Los Altos would become the 6th member of the FRCA and stand on equal footing with Guatemala, severely weakening the old capital’s power over the rest of the country.\n\nWhile this move would be extremely popular among liberals and generally Non-Guatemalans, it will without a doubt antagonize the local conservatives even more and potentially only prolong the war in the province."
  journal_flavor_central_america.19.a: "We welcome Los Altos as a new member of the Federation!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.19.b: "Best to not escalate the situation further..."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.20.t: "Rafael Carrera killed!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.20.d: "Without the Federal Intervention in Guatemala, #bold Rafael Carrera#! has overestimated his ability to overthrow the government in Guatemala, getting himself killed in an unsuccessful attack on Guatemala City!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.20.f: "While many considered it a sign of weakness, it has turned out that the non-intervention in Guatemala has severely warped the perception of the Guatemalan Partisans. Emboldened by the widespread discontent in the province, and with the backing of the rural folks, the Partisans have made their move on Guatemala, causing them to get soundly defeated by a hastily organized militia force.\n\nWhile this is a serious blow to the conservative movement in Guatemala, the inaction of the federal government will most likely cause tensions between the local liberal assembly and the federal government for decades to come."
  journal_flavor_central_america.20.a: "At least that is dealt with."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.21.t: "Carrera flees to Mexico!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.21.d: "With the Federal Intervention in Guatemala, #bold Rafael Carrera#! was unable to take over the provincial government!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.21.f: "The Federal Presence in Guatemala has paid off and after years of guerrilla warfare, the conservatives have finally been dealt a decisive blow as Carrera was forced to cross the border into Mexico. While he will undoubtedly continue to scheme against our government, his departure marks the end of the insurgency in the province for now."
  journal_flavor_central_america.21.a: "At least that is dealt with."
  
  journal_flavor_central_america.22.t: "Morazán Invades!"
  journal_flavor_central_america.22.d: "With the remnants of the Federal Government in disarray, former President Francisco Morazán has fled to Costa Rica and usurped the provincial government."
  journal_flavor_central_america.22.f: "As the dust settles across the isthmus, the former federation that once dominated the region is no more.\n\nUnwilling to accept this outcome, Francisco Morazán has made his way to Costa Rica where he established himself as our new head of state, ready to continue the fight to preserve the unity of Central America.\n\nOnly time will tell if this last ditch effort to save the country will work out."
  journal_flavor_central_america.22.a: "Dios, Unión, Libertad!"
