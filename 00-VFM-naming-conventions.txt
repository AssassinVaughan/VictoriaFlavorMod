====================
Events:
====================
--General rule, store under "events/vfm/" for new content. Also append "_events" to all files

-A Country's overall flavor is stored and formatted as "flavor_[CountryName]_events"
-Events that are specifically for journal entries (random_events ={}) are stored as "journal_flavor_[JounalEntryorTagName]_events"
-Any other event that doesn't quite fit the above, or simply as a fallback are stored as "vfm_[ContentName]_events"
